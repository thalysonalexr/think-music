> Simple API for integrating applications that want to adhere to this idea.

## What it this?

This is an API built with NodeJS and express to study ORM concepts with sequelize and a compilation of other knowledge. This is a simple idea for a service or a Web for data management of interpretations about musics.

## Birth of idea

One of the things I love the most in this life is music. Many of the songs that I hear your lyrics essentially translate into something in my life, and of course it comes from a proper interpretation, think of something more intrinsic. Well, I developed this api in order to put an idea into practice that are apps in which I can register my thoughts on what some songs are for me and also to compile some knowledge I recently acquired. If you are a frontend developer, feel free to create applications to consume this API and give the user xp that I and many others would like. Any questions talk to me, any new ideas for this project make a pull request! The community is open, be a collaborator, beforehand, welcome.
